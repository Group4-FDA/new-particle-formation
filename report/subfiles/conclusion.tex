This project focused on the task of building and evaluating classification models for the problem of new particle formation. Data visualisation and exploratory data analysis was conducted prior to deciding on dimensionality reduction for feature selection. The machine learning model building pipeline was explained, after which the results discussed. PCA was shown to improve models which were not overfitting, while degrading models which were already overfitting.

In terms of future work, more fine-grained feature selection could be conducted. Furthermore, a bigger dataset could help identify more subtle features of the features and their relationships, which could also lead to better models. Considering other features such as the time of the year based on the date may also be a good contributing factor to consider.
