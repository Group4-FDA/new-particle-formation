A new particle formation (NPF) is an event, where small particle starts to form into new larger particles. It takes place in the troposphere and is an important contributor to cloud formation. This report focuses on how we perform exploration, preprocessing and prediction of NPF event types using different generative and discriminative models. Our results show that using the Logistic Regressor with class balanced weights is the best model which overall best optimizes for both binary as well as multiclass accuracy.
